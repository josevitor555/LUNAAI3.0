# About Dictionary variables

```js
const requestOptions = {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${API_KEY}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        model: "text-davinci-003",
        prompt: userText,
        max_tokens: 2048,
        temperature: 0.5,
        n: 1,
        stop: null
    })
};
```
```js
model: "text-davinci-003",
```
model:
The language model to be used. The "text-davinci-003" template is currently used, but you can try other available templates like "gpt-3.5-turbo".
Different models have different abilities and characteristics, so it's recommended to try a few of them to see which one best suits your use case.
```js
prompt: userText,
```
prompt:
This is the text input you provide to the AI. It's the initial message you want the AI ​​to generate a response to. Make sure the message is worded well to get an accurate response.
```js
max_tokens: 2048,
```
max_tokens:
Defines the maximum number of tokens in the generated response. A token is a unit of text that can be a word or a character. Setting this value can help control the length ofresponses and ensure they are more relevant and concise. If you want shorter and more direct answers, you can reduce this value.
```js
temperature: 0.5,
```
temperature:
This parameter controls the degree of randomness of responses generated by the AI. Higher values ​​like 0.7 make responses more creative and diverse, while lower values ​​like 0.2 make responses
more focused and conservative. If you want more accurate and consistent answers, you can use a smaller value like 0.2.
```js
n: 1,
```
n:
This parameter controls how many alternative responses are generated by the model. Setting n to 1 means that only one response is generated, which may be sufficient for many cases. If you want multiple responses to evaluate different options, you can increase this value.
```js
stop: null
```
 stop:
This is an optional parameter that allows you to specify a string at which response generation should stop. It is useful when you want the AI ​​to stop generating text after a certain phrase or word. If you know that the desired answer ends with a specific sentence, it can be useful to use this parameter to avoid very long or irrelevant answers. Set to "null" or "."
